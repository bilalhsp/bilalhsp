## Hi there 👋  

I'm **Bilal Ahmed** 🎓, a PhD student broadly interested in **machine learning 🤖, generative models ✨, and neuroscience 🧠**.  
Currently, I’m exploring how **deep neural networks** can help explain **auditory cortex activity 🎧** and how **diffusion models 🌌** can be applied to solve **inverse problems 🔍**.  

---

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- Solving inverse problems using **diffusion models**  
- Understanding the **auditory cortex** using deep learning  
- Pretraining audio models on natural sound datasets  

---

### 🌱 What I’m learning
- Numerical solutions of **ODEs**  
- Self-supervised and generative modeling techniques  

---

### 📂 Featured Projects
- [🧠 deep-auditory-spikes](https://github.com/bilalhsp/deep-auditory-spikes) — Code for our published paper on modeling spiking activity in auditory cortex  
- [🌌 diffusion-hub](https://github.com/bilalhsp/diffusion-hub) — A framework for training diffusion models across different applications  
- [🎧 audio-dnn](https://github.com/bilalhsp/audio-dnn) — Training deep neural networks for audio processing
